  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the QuickRepair rebrand requirements. All core components (Navbar, Hero, Services, AboutUs, ContactUs, Footer, FloatingButtons) are rebuilt or updated. Removed components (BookingForm, BookingHistory, EmergencySOS, InAppChat, LiveTracking, OtpFlow, PaymentPage, ProviderProfile, ProviderRegistrationForm, ProvidersSection, RatingReview, ReferEarn, ScheduleBooking) are wiped from the UI. Most requirements are satisfied. A few concerns exist: tailwind.config.js and index.css are not visible in the diff (omitted due to limits), creating uncertainty about brand token registration. The copyright line uses a dynamic year instead of hardcoded 2024. Extra UI elements not specified in the requirements were added.",

      "requirement": "Tailwind config and index.css updated with #FFD700 yellow and #ff8c42 orange brand tokens",
      "reason": "The diff does not include tailwind.config.js or index.css among the visible modified files. Components reference 'text-brand-yellow', 'text-brand-orange', 'bg-navy' etc., implying tokens should exist, but the actual config/CSS files are listed as omitted due to limits so confirmation is not possible.",
